{"name": "Anonymous", "date": "5th May 2020", "text": ["So, I was in my senior year in high-school when this happened. I studied in a school run by nuns, and they had the strictest rules. I was a rule breaker, because I always did what I thought was right. So I had coaching classes that our school had arranged for my entrance exams and it was summer holidays, so I skipped and went to watch a movie with two of my friends. Some of the boys did that too, and unfortunately, a few days later, our principal caught us. Now, we had been extremely careful about it, and I was a new student in the school. Since senior year started early, many of the people didn\u2019t know me. So all of the boys, assumed it was me who snitched, but I\u2019m actually not comfortable with lies, and I try to be as honest as possible, (unless its about chocolates.) Now after actual school began, there was this incident with some of my juniors where this boy had told them some lie, which I knew the truth about. These kids asked me, and I told them the truth. I guess this boy had been trying to date that junior he lied to I guess, so he got pretty mad at me for ruining his chances. So one day when I came home after class, he called me on the phone and started calling me everything like butch, and pussy, and cunt, and I tried to shrug it off. I actually felt amused, because I felt kinda sorry for him, I mean, what sort of douche bag tries to start a relationship by lying? So I kinda laughed and asked this boy mockingly if that was the only insults he knew, because being called something that was biologically part of my body, I literally didn\u2019t feel like it was an insult. So I was like, okay, fuck this. And then suddenly, he says, \u201coh you\u2019re smiling? You think this is funny? I\u2019ll make your smile vanish you little cunt! What\u2019s the size of those bulges you got on your chest eh? You bloody slut!\u201d And I just froze for a second or two. I\u2019d love to tell you that I said something badass, but I kinda broke down. I\u2019d gone through a lot of harrasment before, but this was somebody I knew! Somebody I had to go to school with. Somebody my friends were friends with. Somebody of my own year! I had had experiences like this from the guy I liked before, but he was older than me, and I could just completely avoid him. But this\u2026  I snapped and yelled back at him, and cut the call. The next day in school, I did smack him, and my girls did stand with me, so I felt a little better, but then he ruined my whole year, telling everyone from my batch that I was a whore, and all the boys stopped talking to me and even made the girls stop talking to me too. I got them back by the end of the year of course, and I forgave the guy, and people do actually believe me, but not fully. And it sucks."], "tags": ["School"]},

The same thing happened outside a nightclub in a European city a couple of summers ago at the age of 19, and by this point I had learnt a lot more about consent and myself, so I was more angry that a man had the audacity to touch me, but again that I felt guilty of making a fuss about it because I had a (current) boyfriend. It really angers me that I did not get the opportunity to speak my mind to either of these males in the two situations as they had walked off by the time I turned around, and that they had considered my body as a public property.

So I had coaching classes that our school had arranged for my entrance exams and it was summer holidays, so I skipped and went to watch a movie with two of my friends. Some of the boys did that too, and unfortunately, a few days later, our principal caught us. Now, we had been extremely careful about it, and I was a new student in the school. Since senior year started early, many of the people didn\u2019t know me. So all of the boys, assumed it was me who snitched, but I\u2019m actually not comfortable with lies, and I try to be as honest as possible, (unless its about chocolates.) Now after actual school began, there was this incident with some of my juniors where this boy had told them some lie, which I knew the truth about. These kids asked me, and I told them the truth. I guess this boy had been trying to date that junior he lied to I guess, so he got pretty mad at me for ruining his chances. So one day when I came home after class, he called me on the phone and started calling me everything like butch, and pussy, and cunt, and I tried to shrug it off. I actually felt amused, because I felt kinda sorry for him, I mean, what sort of douche bag tries to start a relationship by lying? So I kinda laughed and asked this boy mockingly if that was the only insults he knew, because being called something that was biologically part of my body, I literally didn\u2019t feel like it was an insult. So I was like, okay, fuck this. And then suddenly, he says, \u201coh you\u2019re smiling? You think this is funny? I\u2019ll make your smile vanish you little cunt! What\u2019s the size of those bulges you got on your chest eh? You bloody slut!\u201d And I just froze for a second or two.

Somebody my friends were friends with. Somebody of my own year! I had had experiences like this from the guy I liked before, but he was older than me, and I could just completely avoid him. But this\u2026  I snapped and yelled back at him, and cut the call. The next day in school, I did smack him, and my girls did stand with me, so I felt a little better, but then he ruined my whole year, telling everyone from my batch that I was a whore, and all the boys stopped talking to me and even made the girls stop talking to me too.

I have a kind of amnesia since childhood, and if someone would have told me the reason or it a year ago, I wouldn\u2019t have believed it. I noticed men find me attractive pretty early, when I was followed home at the age of 10. I wore simple jeans, and had even a coat on. It went on this way. I was followed sometimes, and was catcalled, even though back then I didn\u2019t know anything about it. I just got depressed. They called me a slut even in school. When I was 14, I got into a psychiatric clinic. In the meanwhile I still couldn\u2019t step out of the house without recieving catcalls, being groped or followed. Even my first class master sexually assaulted me, though it was \u201conly\u201d petting my thigh and keep on getting intimate even with small touches. The vice-president of the first aider group I worked with also made comments about me, and tried to flirt. He did it to most of the newcomers. My first boyfriend abused my body in my sleep. Everytime we slept together he\u2019d do it. And I forgot it daily. I woke up everyday, reading through my notes to learn where am I or who I am exactly. I didn\u2019t notice all these because my mind went blank, and I basically was like a zombie. I didn\u2019t dare to think. Also everytime I went to a party, someone tried to get me. Since my ex was real jealous and controlling, we only went to parties together. In one I still got drugged. My period is irregular, and once when it came after 2 months. It always hurts like hell to the point that in the begining I can\u2019t even stand up, so I usually complain about it a lot, and so I did to him. He said he already thought I was pregnant. \u201cHow could I be? We use condoms\u201d- I said to which he told me the condom ripped once. When I managed to gather my courage and break up with him, I already had sight symptoms of PTSD. I also only then realized he wanted me pregnant to make sure I won\u2019t leave him. Later on with the help of therapy (took four years until now) I found out what caused my amnesia throughout my whole life. A friend of my dad raped me at the age of 5. I still don\u2019t know how to deal with my flashbacks, and this whole thing. I don\u2019t dare to talk when I need to, because I feel ashamed and all used up. I can\u2019t get myself to talk, because whenever I try to, I feel that it\u2019s too much for people. Uncomfortable. So I keep silent about my needs. But at least I now have enough confidence to stand up for others, and that is why I must thank you. All of the people who are raising their voices. You saved my life, and not even just once.

I woke up this morning to a message from another guy on the chat, saying that this guy had sent my selfie to both chats. This made me have a panic attack. I have paranoia and mild anxiety and I told him that the reason why I didn\u2019t post the selfie on the chats was because I was afraid that someone would reverse google search it, would find my actual social medias and would ruin my life (I know, insane, but I wouldn\u2019t put it past some of the guys on the chats). To make matters worse, one of the guys who I\u2019ve had an issue with from day one actually posted my selfie on his account, with my username and asked people to call me a stupid whore.

Yesterday, I randomly came across a video on my facebook feed, where an adult man was asssaulting a little boy, about 8 or 9 years old, and a woman was trying but failing to protect him. It was all in a language I don\u2019t understand but it was pretty clear what was happening \ud83d\ude41 first he hit hit with his hands then with an iron rod, no I\u2019m not making it up. He kicked the little boy in the face. He found another hard object and jammed it in his face as hard as he could. At one point the boy vomited. The grown man doing the assault (probably a brother, about 18-20 years old), was frighteningly calm the whole time, pausing before the different attacks to gather his strategies like in a boxing match. I know, what has this got to do with sexism? Obviously, toxic masculinity, cycles of abuse, women like the woman in this video not being able to interfere and protect the young victim because then they would be assaulted too and possibly killed. This sort of violence is a result of toxic masculinity. The reason I\u2019m sharing this is because seeing it actually happen is totally different from just hearing about it. Of course it must be a whole other story for those who had to grow up in such a household. I can\u2019t imagine what it might be like. Just seeing such brutal violence made me sick to my stomach. It frightens me that some people are so deeply intrenched in the belief that they are above the other person and can treat them any way they want that they would go this far or even further.
