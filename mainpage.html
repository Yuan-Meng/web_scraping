<p>The Everyday Sexism Project exists to catalogue instances of sexism experienced on a day to day basis. They might be serious or minor, outrageously offensive or so niggling and normalised that you don’t even feel able to protest. Say as much or as little as you like, use your real name or a pseudonym – it’s up to you. By sharing your story you’re showing the world that sexism does exist, it is faced by women everyday and it is a valid problem to discuss.

If you prefer to e-mail me at laura@everydaysexism.com I can upload your story for you instead. Follow us on Twitter (and submit entries by tweet) at @EverydaySexism.

<p>This happened a few months ago but I remembered it again today. I was sat in a pub with my boyfriend and his male housemate (I miss pubs!) watching sports on TV. The footage of the game cut to commentary from the studio and one of the commentators was a middle aged woman. &#8216;Oh great,&#8217; said the housemate, &#8216;time for the ugly old woman.&#8217; I was shocked &#8211; not only that he was thinking this, but also that he said it so conversationally, as if we would obviously both agree with him. Not that it&#8217;s relevant, but she definitely wasn&#8217;t ugly. And needless to say, he didn&#8217;t feel the need to comment on the appearance of the middle aged male commentator sat next to her.</p>

<p>I was 14 doing a Saturday job in a garden center. I was tasked with clearing out one of the storage units with a colleague. He was probably at least 50 and quite overweight. </p>
<p>As we worked we chatted and laughed etc. Then at one point he pulled me over to him and kissed me. He took my hand and pushed it down his pants. i remember thinking he had a really small dick and not really knowing how to react. He started to undo my trousers but I told him to stop because I was on my period. He checked, and I was, so he stopped. We went back to work like it was nothing. I told a colleague and he said &#8220;Yes, &#091;he*&#093; can be persuasive.&#8221; He told me he&#8217;d put a knife in the drawer in the storage unit for me as I was working in there with &#091;him&#093; again the next day. The abuser approached me on my next shift and told me that I can&#8217;t tell anyone else because I was underage and he&#8217;ll get reported. </p>
<p>I repressed that memory for years until one day it came back to me. I still wonder what would have happened to me if I wasn&#8217;t on my period. I know I wouldn&#8217;t have stopped him, we were out in a storage unit and he was twice my size, he could have killed me. </p>
<p>As I&#8217;m typing this out now, so many years later, it&#8217;s juts suddenly made me realise&#8230; the person that I told, the one who put a knife for my protection to be helpful, actually chose to warn the abuser that I&#8217;d said something instead of reporting the sexual assault of a 14 year old. That really stings&#8230; all these years I thought he was the good guy of the story, he&#8217;s not&#8230; he was just covering for an abuser instead of being one. </p>
<p>(*I&#8217;m not protecting his identity, I just don&#8217;t remember his name, and I don&#8217;t want to.)</p>

<p>When I was a smaller I loved to play sports. Especially tackle or touch football. I was really amazing at it and I loved it so much, it was just my favourite sport. One day I was playing in a tournament with some girls I’ve never met before because my school forbidden girls to play ‘ violent boy sports ‘. That game I was knocked out halfway through. After that game I was forbid to ever play sports again because sports were supposedly meant to be for ‘strong boys or men who could handle the sport’ and not for ‘frail and weak women who couldn’t handle pain’. I hated the fact that I was forced out of my most favourite sport because I was a women. It was bad enough that my dad didn’t like the idea of me doing it before the knock-out but they used a simple injury as a reason to doubt my strength and abuse my gender status for there own beliefs. It made me feel as though my gender was worth nothing and that I had little to no power.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a twenty-year-old woman, and I have a lot of male friends. I also have four brothers and their friends are my friends, too. What I hate, hate, hate (!) is when my brother dismisses my new interest in gaming as &#8220;bullshit&#8221; or when my roommates say &#8220;you&#8217;re kind of a dude&#8221;. I like roughhousing and videogames. I also like flowing dresses and nail polish. Is it so hard to believe women are complex beings?</p>

<section class="entry-content">
<p>So, I was in my senior year in high-school when this happened. I studied in a school run by nuns, and they had the strictest rules. I was a rule breaker, because I always did what I thought was right. So I had coaching classes that our school had arranged for my entrance exams and it was summer holidays, so I skipped and went to watch a movie with two of my friends. Some of the boys did that too, and unfortunately, a few days later, our principal caught us. Now, we had been extremely careful about it, and I was a new student in the school. Since senior year started early, many of the people didn&#8217;t know me. So all of the boys, assumed it was me who snitched, but I&#8217;m actually not comfortable with lies, and I try to be as honest as possible, (unless its about chocolates.) Now after actual school began, there was this incident with some of my juniors where this boy had told them some lie, which I knew the truth about. These kids asked me, and I told them the truth. I guess this boy had been trying to date that junior he lied to I guess, so he got pretty mad at me for ruining his chances. So one day when I came home after class, he called me on the phone and started calling me everything like butch, and pussy, and cunt, and I tried to shrug it off. I actually felt amused, because I felt kinda sorry for him, I mean, what sort of douche bag tries to start a relationship by lying? So I kinda laughed and asked this boy mockingly if that was the only insults he knew, because being called something that was biologically part of my body, I literally didn&#8217;t feel like it was an insult. So I was like, okay, fuck this. And then suddenly, he says, &#8220;oh you&#8217;re smiling? You think this is funny? I&#8217;ll make your smile vanish you little cunt! What&#8217;s the size of those bulges you got on your chest eh? You bloody slut!&#8221; And I just froze for a second or two. I&#8217;d love to tell you that I said something badass, but I kinda broke down. I&#8217;d gone through a lot of harrasment before, but this was somebody I knew! Somebody I had to go to school with. Somebody my friends were friends with. Somebody of my own year! I had had experiences like this from the guy I liked before, but he was older than me, and I could just completely avoid him. But this&#8230;  I snapped and yelled back at him, and cut the call. The next day in school, I did smack him, and my girls did stand with me, so I felt a little better, but then he ruined my whole year, telling everyone from my batch that I was a whore, and all the boys stopped talking to me and even made the girls stop talking to me too. I got them back by the end of the year of course, and I forgave the guy, and people do actually believe me, but not fully. And it sucks.</p>

<p>I did not realise when I stumbled on this website that I had ever been assaulted or experienced any sexism, however when I read some of these entries small things that I had brushed aside started to come back.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m 13 and last year when I was 12 a guy from my class touched my bum, when I turned around he pretended he hadn&#8217;t done anything and then ran of laughing to his friends. When I told my friends later on the just said maybe he liked me. Later that day he did it again, but I didn&#8217;t say anything and I didn&#8217;t even think of it as weird. I felt uncomfortable about it but didn&#8217;t want to confront him about it because I would be labelled as stressy or bitchy. </p>
<p>There&#8217;s another guy who is in a lot of my lessons who&#8217;s always making sexual remarks about not only my body, but every girl he sees. When he makes comments about what he would do to our bodies everyone can here him but they just laugh or say &#8220;he does that to everyone,&#8221; even the teachers turn a blind eye or say things like (lets call him H) &#8220;H, stop teasing the girls,&#8221; but it doesn&#8217;t feel like just teasing. You end up going home feeling disgusted with your body because you blame it for attracting the wrong kind of people.</p>
<p>I know this isn&#8217;t half as bad as what other people have been through, but I just needed to say something.</p>

<p>When I was about 16 I went to an u18s night at a local nightclub with my friends. At the time I had a non-serious, quite platonic, non-sexual relationship with a boy, who I classed as a boyfriend (although he wasn&#8217;t a very nice one). When I was dancing with my friends some boy around our age groped my bum twice in the night. Whenever he came near us I felt really uncomfortable, and not just because it wasn&#8217;t at all consented by me (I literally did not know him, hadn&#8217;t even spoken to him, or looked at him) but more that I was in a relationship and felt like it was wrong of me to have been touched by another man. The same thing happened outside a nightclub in a European city a couple of summers ago at the age of 19, and by this point I had learnt a lot more about consent and myself, so I was more angry that a man had the audacity to touch me, but again that I felt guilty of making a fuss about it because I had a (current) boyfriend. It really angers me that I did not get the opportunity to speak my mind to either of these males in the two situations as they had walked off by the time I turned around, and that they had considered my body as a public property. I&#8217;m also very aware how fortunate I am in my situations compared to so many other girls that are sexually assaulted in nightclubs and public places, which angers me even more on their behalf.</p>

<p>When I was in a high school, I was just a calm kid, not sporty at all and liked staying home. Because of that I was bullied by my peers, they called me not stylish, not modern, not beautiful. Only when we talked face to face to someone they behaved properly, but when they were in a group, they started laughing at me(cowards). And while I was talking to my classmate he said that it would be better for me to go away now as other guys are gonna come from the meeting and will start bullying me even more. &#8220;This is much easier to take a pain killer, instead of remove the problem&#8221;.-A sad passenger</p>

<section class="entry-content">
<p>I worked in a holiday resort abroad as a singer/musician for 8 months. At age 22 and a recent graduate I was incredibly excited to embark on my first contract but also nervous to leave my family, friends and boyfriend behind.</p>
<p>In my team there were 3 girls and 8 boys. Throughout the resort, the locals who worked behind the bar and in the restaurants were majority men and these were the people we mostly interacted with as our entertainment team worked the evenings unlike the other British workers. I am a bubbly, chatty person and when I first moved out there I was accused of being the type of girl to “give the wrong impression” or told I was a “flirt/tease” because despite the fact the majority of my colleagues were in fact men, it looked “attention seeking” that I was trying to be friends with the boys. My colleagues. I was told that I should stop speaking to the bartenders because they “obviously fancied me” and by speaking to them I was encouraging it despite the fact I regularly and openly spoke about my boyfriend with everyone and showed absolutely no interest in anyone else. It was my fault they fancied me because I asked how their day was going when I ordered a drink.</p>
<p>I was so desperate to feel less isolated and make friends that I told myself to stay true to who I am and block out the negative chatter and countless accusations. My boss regularly reminded me I needed to be careful because I was an “attractive girl” and some of the other girls won’t be used to the attention like I was and I should “know better”. He made me feel so small and so guilty simply for being open and confident with my coworkers but masked it as him “protecting me”.</p>
<p>I soon felt heavily judged and isolated. I was rarely in touch with other girls in the hotel as we were on opposite shifts so I felt like I had nobody to talk to because not many of the boys on my team seemed to understand how much I was struggling and why. </p>
<p>I soon befriended one of the local boys behind the bar. We’d had lovely chats at work and one day he saw me sat alone crying and asked me if I was ok. I opened up to him, told him I felt so alone. That I had been made to feel guilty whenever I spoke to anyone of the opposite sex. He was shocked and told me that I should be able to be friends with whoever I want. He soon began to make an effort with me inside and outside of work. He even spoke to my boyfriend on FaceTime and told me all about his girlfriend. My boyfriend was so thankful that I had a friend who would sit with me on the bus and have lunch with me, make work fun again. He was one of my best friends. </p>
<p>However things became difficult, he told me the men in his culture believed it was wrong for a Turkish man to hang out alone with a British woman. He said we couldn’t be friends anymore. I was devastated and hurt. We didn’t speak for a week until he finally apologised, telling me he felt pressure from others and was worried he was going to cause me more problems. We put it behind us and I felt like I had my best friend back. Suddenly I had a friend on the bus again and a friend to have lunch with. </p>
<p>However things became difficult once again. I asked him to hang out with me and my British friends but he said no he didn’t like the idea. Initially I believed it was due to the language barrier. He said he struggled to keep up with a big group of people and it was easier to speak with just me. </p>
<p>One night I had been to a bar with just two girls rather than all the British workers and I finally felt so included and happy to have some girls to hang out with. I’d had quite a few drinks and messaged my best friend who I knew was round the corner to come join us. He asked me who was there and I expected a no again because it was just the British staff, but he immediately said yes and came round to meet us. I was quite surprised. </p>
<p>When he arrived, I was encouraging him to speak to the girls and get to know them. He seemed to feel awkward so I tried to stick by him and make sure he didn’t feel like the odd one out at any point and made sure he understood everything that was being said. Soon the girls decided they wanted to go home but I decided to stay with my friend for a few more drinks since he hadn’t been out for very long and I didn’t want to be rude.</p>
<p>The next thing I know I woke up in my bed with no memories. I immediately felt anxious and scared but it wasn’t until I sat up and looked in the mirror that I went into a meltdown. My face and body were covered in bruises and my neck covered in aggressive hickeys. I was hysterical and I immediately called my boyfriend. The sad part is my immediate reaction was to assume I had cheated. I was staring at myself, covered in bruises and cuts. And because of how I had been treated at work I immediately blamed myself. I looked at the messages on my phone and saw I had messaged two of my friends saying I needed help and I was scared the night before. I also had a message from the boy I had been at the bar with saying “I am sorry for what I did. I left you sleeping.” </p>
<p>The two girls who had been at the bar with me and one of the boys from my team came round to see me. They tried to calm me down and said not to panic and not to start accusing people of anything. I left the room and heard the girls say “to be fair she was flirting with him, I think she’s just made a mistake”. It was like nobody could see the gigantic bruises and cuts that clearly hadn’t come from nowhere. It was like they thought the texts I had sent out asking for help meant nothing.</p>
<p>They then called my boss without my consent and informed him of what happened. When I arrived at work I thought I would arrive to a supportive man who would listen and help me get through the day. Instead I was told it was “my fault” and he had called the bar owner who had apparently told him I was “all over the boy” and said I clearly went home with him, it got a “bit rough” and I woke up and realised I had a boyfriend. I was told that I couldn’t contact the company I worked for to get help because they would be furious with me. I was told I couldn’t under any circumstances tell anyone at the hotel what had happened because I could get sued since there was no evidence and the boy had clearly done nothing wrong. </p>
<p>I had to work in the hotel alongside this boy for the next 2 months. The boy I thought was my best friend at work. His true colours came through as I asked him not to speak to me anymore. He told me I wanted it and he wasn’t the only one to blame. He began to stalk me around the hotel. Waiting outside the rooms I was working in, coming into the hotel on his days off to watch me perform. Filming me on his phone from behind the bar. I felt helpless.</p>
<p>I informed my friends and boss when these things were happening and eventually my boss began to take these claims a bit more seriously. However he still told me I needed to keep it quiet. Most likely to cover his own back because he knew he had messed up. </p>
<p>What was meant to be an exciting new experience, getting to travel and live abroad turned into the worst 8 months of my life. To this day I can’t quite believe what happened. I still blame myself.</p>
